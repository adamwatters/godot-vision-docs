# Roadmap

[Contributions](https://github.com/kevinw/GodotVision) welcome!

**Live Reload**: saving a scene, or modifying a resource in the editor could show in the headset immediately, without having to recompile/redeploy/rerun the Xcode project. Iteration time in gamedev is important!

**Run Godot on background thread**: RealityKit is a relatively heavyweight presence on the main thread. It could be beneficial to have an option to use all those Apple Silicon cores to run Godot on a background thread for more parallelism.
